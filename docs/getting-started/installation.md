# Installation

!!! note
    pySMSpp is a Python package under active development and current documentation aims to facilitate development of the package. Currently, there is not yet a stable release of the package on PyPI or Conda, so the installation can be performed by cloning the repository and installing the package locally.

## Python

To use pySMSpp we highly recommend to use a package manager such as [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) as easy-to-use package managers, available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux.

As common practice, it is highly recommend to use dedicated [conda/mamba environments](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html) or [virtual environments](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) to ensure proper dependency management and isolation.

## Adoption of conda environments

If you are using conda, you can create a new environment with:

```bash
conda create -n pysmspp python=3.10 pip
```

This will create a new environment named `pysmspp` with Python 3.10 and pip package manager installed.

If you prefer mamba, please execute the same command with `mamba` instead of `conda`. For alternative package managers, please refer to their respective documentation.

## Clone the package

To clone the package, you can use the following command:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/folder
git clone https://github.com/SPSUnipi/pySMSpp
```

This will create a new folder named `pySMSpp` in the directory `/path/to/your/folder`

## Installing with pip

You can now install the package locally using pip:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/folder/pySMSpp
pip install .
```

If you aim to develop the package, we recommend to install the package in editable mode (option `-e`), install the development dependencies (option `[dev]`), and install the pre-commit to ensure code quality:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```

## Getting SMS++

To use pySMSpp, you need to have SMS++ installed on your system. You can install the latest version of SMS++ from the [official SMS++ website](https://gitlab.com/smspp/smspp-project).
