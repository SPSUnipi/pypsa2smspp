# Quick Start

To install the package, please refer to [Installation](installation.md).

In the following, we provide a quick example on how to add a simple optimization model with SMS++.
The problem that follows optimizes the dispatch of a single thermal generator of 100kW to meet the demand of a constant load over 24 hours in one bus.

A sample SMS++ network can be created with the following code. After python imports, the code creates a new SMS++ network `sn` with the block file format. The block file format is a text file that contains only the model data in a structured way, with no solver information. The solver information is provided in a separate configuration file.

```python
from pysmspp import SMSNetwork, Variable, Block, SMSFileType, SMSConfig
import numpy as np

sn = SMSNetwork(file_type=SMSFileType.eBlockFile)
```

After an empty network is created, we can populate it with blocks. In particular, it is critical to add a first inner block that describes
the type of model to be optimized. In this case, we are adding a `UCBlock` suitable for unit commitment problems, see the [UCBlock SMS documentation](https://gitlab.com/smspp/ucblock) for details. A `UCBlock` is a block that describes unit commitment problems. In particular, we specify 24 time steps (one day) and a constant demand of 50kW for each time step. The block is added to the network with the following code:

```python
sn.add(
    "UCBlock",  # block type
    "Block_0",  # block name
    id="0",  # block id
    TimeHorizon=24,  # number of time steps
    NumberUnits=1,  # number of units
    NumberElectricalGenerators=1,  # number of electrical generators
    NumberNodes=1,  # number of nodes
    ActivePowerDemand=Variable(  # active power demand
        "ActivePowerDemand",
        "float",
        ("NumberNodes", "TimeHorizon"),
        np.full((1, 24), 50.),  # constant demand of 50kW
    ),
)
```

In the unit commitment block stated above, no generator is yet added. To add a generator, we first create a `ThermalUnitBlock` block using the code below and we add it to the network. The following code adds a thermal unit block to the network. The block is added to the network with the following code:

```python
thermal_unit_block = Block().from_kwargs(
    block_type="ThermalUnitBlock",
    MinPower=Variable("MinPower", "float", (), 0.0),
    MaxPower=Variable("MaxPower", "float", (), 100.),
    LinearTerm=Variable("LinearTerm", "float", (), 0.3),
    InitUpDownTime=Variable("InitUpDownTime", "int", (), 1),
)

sn.blocks["Block_0"].add("ThermalUnitBlock", "UnitBlock_0", block=thermal_unit_block)
```

Finally, the network is optimized with the following code:

```python
configfile = SMSConfig(template="uc_solverconfig")  # path to the template solver config file "uc_solverconfig"
temporary_smspp_file = "./smspp_temp_file.nc"  # path to the temporary SMS++ file used as intermediate file to launch SMS++
output_file = "./smspp_output.txt"  # path to the output file (optional)

result = sn.optimize(
    configfile,
    temporary_smspp_file,
    output_file,
)
```

Finally, basic information are stored in the result object, see:

```python
print("Status: ", result.status)
print("Objective value: ", result.objective_value)
```
